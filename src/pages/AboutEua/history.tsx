    <h1>The History of eUniversity Africa (eUA)</h1>
    <p>
      The idea of a fully online University for the continent of Africa emerged about 10 years ago
      as it became conspicuously evident that a solution to the gaping void in the e-learning
      landscape was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2019 the resolve became more compelling and the need to meet the unmet demands and
      overwhelming appetite for higher education in Africa became more deafening. Global
      developments in open distance and e-learning (ODeL) and the ubiquitous use of Information
      Communication Technologies (ICT) were a strong force pushing us to commence preliminary
      discussion, consultation and preparation to launch an online university. The fortuitous
      catalyst for the emergence of eUA was the current global development from the impact of the
      corona virus (covid-19). The pandemic further ignited the idea and has led to the
      fast-tracking of our plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Africa, the world’s youngest region with the fastest-growing youth population, currently has
      over 1.3billion people. 75% of the population of Africa are rural dwellers, with about 60 per
      cent of its population under 25 years. Yet, the continent has gross undersupply of quality and
      affordable higher education with current tertiary enrolment rates at about 8 percent; well
      below the global average of 32 per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Africa with its vast potential resources must leapfrog to catch up with the developed world.
      The only viable way to do this is through open access to education. This must be delivered
      independent of age, time, location, pace, space, previous level of academic achievement, and
      other artificial barriers to affordable, quality, flexible, easily accessible and globally
      competitive education as a life-long pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eUniversity Africa is established to harness the enormous transformative energy of online
      platforms to deliver a new type of teaching and learning to propel Africa through a 21st
      century of knowledge economy and human capital development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision for the eUniversity is a 21st century e-learning provision that is multi-modal,
      offering multi-dimensional differential learning and instructional pathways with a judicious
      and results-oriented balance between academic and hands-on learning. This will utilise
      Africa’s resources to become a global point-of-reference in the use of digital learning to
      transform society in wealth creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      eUA’s mission, amongst others, is to become a trail blazer and a world inspiration, using a
      robust afro-centric learning management system and other locally developed applications for
      personalised education.
    </p>
    <p>
      eUA provides low cost experiential, high quality learning pathways towards the world of
      employment and entrepreneurial leadership. This novel institution inculcates a myriad of
      multi-skills to tackle an ever-changing multi-tasking world as well as implant in the learner
      the ability to think, learn and innovate freely and creatively.
