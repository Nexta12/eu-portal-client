          acknowledge that any exams, quizzes, or questions provided in relation to each Program are
          intended solely for your individual use. Copying, capturing, transmitting, or sharing any

          address, a password for your User Account, and any additional information as required
          herein or on the relevant Service. In certain instances, EUA may offer a virtual classroom

          may provide such participants with separate credentials (referred to as &quot;Login
          Credentials&quot;) necessary to register for and access the program. You acknowledge and
          agree that you will keep your User Account or Login Credential confidential and never
          share access or access information with any third party for any reason. You also affirm
          that you will create, use, and/or access only one User Account or Login Credential and
          refrain from using any other User Account or Login Credential to access the Services.
        </Paragraph>

          provided by you is accurate, up-to-date, complete, and in compliance with the obligations
          set forth in the Agreements. Additionally, you agree to maintain and promptly update such
          information to ensure its accuracy, currency, and completeness. Should any information you
          provide be found to be false, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, we retain the right to,
          at our sole discretion, terminate your access to any or all of the Services.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Upon being admitted to a EUA Program, or during your registration process, you may be
          required to submit a headshot photo of yourself (via webcam or any other method designated

          the Agreements), you shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata refund of any fees paid in
          connection with the Program. Additionally, it is eUniversity Africa&apos;s policy to
          terminate users of the Services who are repeat copyright infringers, without limiting any
          of eUniversity Africa&apos;s other rights or remedies. eUniversity Africa may refuse to

          and/or credentials or acknowledgments, if eUniversity Africa believes such service or
          activity may violate any applicable law or regulation. You acknowledge that your sole
          relationship with eUniversity Africa for the purpose of any Program is as defined in the
          Agreements. Termination does not grant you the right to engage in any grievance or other
          resolution process for student disputes at EUA, or any other school, division, institute,
          or program associated with EUA. Moreover, eUniversity Africa has the right to cancel,

          your participation by providing notice to eUniversity Africa. Upon any termination of your
          right to use the Services or your participation in a Program, the rights granted hereunder
          will cease, but other provisions of the Agreements will remain in effect after such
          termination.

          Except as prohibited by applicable law, eUniversity Africa shall not be liable to you or

          Africa. The disclaimers and limitations set forth in this section shall apply, to the
          maximum extent permitted by applicable law, whether or not eUniversity Africa has been
          negligent or otherwise at fault.

          willingness to make the service and programs available to you. Each of these disclaimers

          any other person, related to your taking exams at Test Sites (including travel to and from
          Test Sites), resulting from any cause, including but not limited to negligence on your
          part or on the part of any of the released parties.
